            <p>
                &emsp;As the first world war began, and even prior to America joining the fight, America became one of the main suppliers of weaponry to the war effort. Used for dynamite and other munitions, industrial alcohol became incredibly profitable, and as a consequence, so did molasses.<br><br>&emsp;One tank in Boston, quickly built in 1915 by United States Industrial Alcohol (USIA), was constructed to extremely low standards. Able to hold over 2 million gallons of molasses, the tank was haphasardly built, resulting in the tank often rumbling and leaking. The leaking got to the point that children began to collect cups of the molasses that seeped from the cracks. After multiple complaints of the leaks, USIA painted the tank brown to hide the damage.<br><br>&emsp;On January 12th 1919, in temperatures around 40 degrees fahrenheit, a ship loaded 600,000 gallons of warm molasses into the tank. This was likily the final straw, and due to thermal expansion, poor construction, cold temperatures, and an amalgamation of other factors, only 3 days later, on January 15th 1919 at around 12:40pm, the tank finally gave out.

                    &emsp;2.3 million gallons of molasses, nearly 3.5 olympic swimming pools, surged down Commercial Street at 35 miles per hour. The torrent swept up houses, horses, and people alike, totalling 21 deaths and 150 injuries. The rescue efforts took four days, and it was many more until all of the bodies could be recovered and identified.<br><br>&emsp;The wave destroyed most of the surrounding buildings, including the Engine 31 firehouse, the Clougherty house and the O' Brien house, and heavily damaged sections of the nearby elevated train track.<br><br>&emsp;The immidiate area surrounding the tank took weeks to clean, and the harbor remained brown for months. Molasses was also tracked far into the city, into trains, telephones, homes, and other places.<br><br>&emsp;The full recovery took months, and it took many more months before the city stopped smelling faintly like molasses in the summer heat.

                    &emsp;Following the events of the flood, the people who were affected filed a class action lawsuit against USIA, arguing that the construction of the tank was at fault. USIA, however, argued that the rupture was due to the result of a bomb by anarchists.<br><br>&emsp;Over the 5 year long proceeding, 1,000 witnesses testified, and 1,500 exhibits were introduced. However, eventually, it was ruled that the shoddy manufacturing of the tank was to blame. Eventually, USIA would have to pay the victims a total of $628,000 (approximately 11 million dollars today).<br><br>&emsp;Soon after the ruling, Boston, alongside many cities, states, and the federal government, employed stricter regulations and building codes, many of which still influence society to this day.
